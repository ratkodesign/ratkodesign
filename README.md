- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @ratkodesign, a passionate designer and web developer hailing from the captivating landscapes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 


My journey in the world of design began in 2012 when I took my first steps as a graphic designer. Over the years, my love for creative expression led me to explore the ever-evolving realm of web design and development.

I take pride in being a versatile creative, a jack of many trades, but at my core, I am a designer. Whether it's crafting stunning visual identities, architecting user-friendly websites, or delving into the captivating world of 3D design, I thrive on the endless possibilities that design offers.

My journey has been a blend of continuous learning and growth, and I relish the challenges that each new idea brings. As a designer and web developer, my mission is to create not just beautiful visuals but also seamless digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
